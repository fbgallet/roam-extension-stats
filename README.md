### [See changelog here for an overview of updates and new features](https://github.com/fbgallet/roam-extension-footnotes/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md) üÜï

### Insert a footnote
**üÜï New feature** (v.2): you can directly create footnotes in the same way that you can natively insert a new child block by simply typing the text after a double bracket: `((my note...`. You have only to choose the "Create as footnote" option in the autocomplete popup (Arrow up + Enter).
Thanks üôè to [Matt Vogel](https://github.com/8bitgentleman) for the idea and its important contribution to the code.

Or press `Ctrl + Alt + F` (or Ctrl + Shift + F as an option) at the location where you want to insert the note: 
  - a new block is created, under the header #footnotes (customizable, under a line or not) and opened in the sidebar, to enter the note (üÜï new in v.3: the note block is automaticaly focused),
  - if some text is selected when you press the hotkeys to insert the note, the text is automatically copied into the note (and the note is not opened in the sidebar, since its content is already defined),
  - a numbered alias is inserted (in superscript as an option),
  - all following notes on the page are automatically renumbered.

### Delete a footnote
Select, in the main text, the number of the note (the selection can be overflowing without problem, but it must contain at most one note number), then press `Ctrl + Alt + F`:
  - the note block will be deleted,
  - if there was some content in the note block, it will be inserted in the text body, in place of the alias,
    or (üÜï **new feature in v.2**) you can choose to replace the alias by the note number in brackets (better for exporting) and keep the note block,
  - all following notes on the page are automatically renumbered.
  
üÜï New command in v.2: you can delete all footnotes on page in bulk (only the alias, the note blocks will note be deleted, since you can easily delete them at once) with `Footnotes: Warning, danger zone! Delete all footnotes on current page` command. It can be useful to export more easily its content to a classic document, since you can replace all alias by the number in brackets.

### Reorder / Renumber footnotes
If you move blocks or parts of text, or if you manually delete notes by mistake, you can reorder the list of notes and correct their numbering.
Simply run `Footnotes: Reorder footnotes on current page` command, from the command palette (Ctrl+P).

### SmartBlocks commands
You can insert or delete a footnote using SmartBlocks commands: `<%INSERTFOOTNOTE%>` and `<%DELETEFOOTNOTE%>`.
To delete a footnote, place the cursor just before the footnote number, search the SmartBlocks and click on its name in the autocomplete box (press enter doesn't work here if you are using superscript footnote, because of the #sup tag autocomplete box)

You will need to create SmartBlocks like this:
```
#SmartBlock Insert footnote
    - <%INSERTFOOTNOTE%>
#SmartBlock Delete footnote
    - <%DELETEFOOTNOTE%>

```
