Just over any bullet to see the following info:

- Creation date
- Character and word count in current block
- Carcarcter and word count in children blocks, and children block count
- DONE/TODO ratio and percentage (or progress bar with 6 boxes: "ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©ðŸŸ©â–¡â–¡â–¡" means more that 50%, less than 66%)

Do you think other information could be useful? Don't hesitate to let me know!
